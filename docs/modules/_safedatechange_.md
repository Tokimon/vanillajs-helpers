*Defined in [safeDateChange.ts:23](https://github.com/Tokimon/vanillajs-helpers/blob/d56b968/safeDateChange.ts#L23)*



Verifies and corrects Dates where the month could accedently have skipped into the next month because the date is out of bounds by the month changed to.

    const date = new Date(2017, 0, 31);
    newDate = new Date(date);
    newDate.setMonth(1);
    
    // Normally you would expect "newDate" month to be February, but since the date
    // of the previous date was 31 and february max date is 28 (or 29), the actual
    // "newDate" is "Match 3rd 2017" (or 2nd). Using this function keeps it at "February 28 2017"
    
    safeDateChange(date, newDate);
    
    // newDate === "February 28 2017"
